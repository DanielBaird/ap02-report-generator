$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$sp_current_total species.  By YEAR, the total species is projected to remain unchanged, however the species composition changes, with XX species new to the region replacing the XX species lost.

**overall change up, ins, no outs**
$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$sp_current_total species.  By YEAR this number is projected to increase to TT, due to XX species new to the region.

**overall change up, ins > outs**
$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$sp_current_total species.  By YEAR this number is projected to increase/decrease to TT species.  This change will be caused by XX losses and YY gains.

**overall change down, outs, no ins**
$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$sp_current_total species.  By YEAR this number is projected to decrease to TT, a loss of XX species.

**overall change down, outs > ins**
$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$sp_current_total species.  By YEAR this number is projected to increase/decrease to TT species.  This change will be caused by XX losses and YY gains.

**all cases, if added > 0**
Note that where additional species are mentioned, this refers to climate suitability only, and the actual  presence of species in a region will depend on factors such as dispersal capacity.

Introduction
------------

This report covers blah and blah by doing blah and blah.  It uses data projected out to 2085[[year == 2085]].[[year < 2085]], but focusses on the projected climate and biodiversity situation in $$year.
[[always]]
Projection of Future Climate
----------------------------

These results were generated by blah blah.  Projections of the future climate depend on factors to do with scenario/situation etc and accuracy of models.  We selected two scenarios, high and low emissions, etc.  Multiple models were used and the projections of each model blah blah distribution 10% / 50% / 90%.

Uncertainties remain in human activities, accuracy in modelling climate-related geo/bio systems, approximations used when setting modelling resolution, etc etc

Projection of Future Species Distribution
-----------------------------------------

Climate suitability for each species was generated by blah blah. Projections of climate suitability depends on factors such as accuracy and completeness of observation records, sensitivity to various climatological factors, the change in those factors, picking a survival threshold, etc etc.

Uncertainties remain in climate projection, selection of bioclim variables, anthropogenic changes in habitat suitability, survivability of rare events e.g. drought, cyclone, rate of spread into new areas etc etc

Regional Climate Projections
----------------------------

Figure 1 shows the projected change in annual average temperature across $$rg_short_name, in low and high emission scenarios.  Projections are shown for 10th percentile etc etc.

[[year < 2085]]Note that this figure shows projections for 2085.[[always]]

Highest change across the region is blah blah.

Figure 2 shows the annual average temperature for $$rg_short_name, in low and high emission scenarios.

Regional Biodiversity Implications
----------------------------------

[[      sp_high_$$year_d_up   == 0
    and sp_high_$$year_d_down == 0
]] (no change at all)

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$sp_current_total species. The climate in $$year is projected to remain suitable for all species.

[[      sp_high_$$year_d_up != 0
    and sp_high_$$year_d_up == sp_high_$$year_d_down
]] (no overall change, ins = outs)

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$sp_current_total
species. By $$year, the total number of species is projected to stay the same, however a change in climate suitability suggests a change in species composition.  The climate is projected to become
unsuitable for $$sp_high_$$year_d_down species XnativeXtoXtheXregionX (losses) and suitable for $$sp_high_$$year_d_up species (gains).

[[      sp_high_$$year_d_up    > 0
    and sp_high_$$year_d_down == 0
]] (overall change up, ins, no outs)

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$sp_current_total
species. By $$year this number is projected to increase by $$sp_high_$$year_d_up species to sp_high_$$year_total.
The climate is likely to remain suitable for species currently
found in the region.

[[      sp_high_$$year_d_up   != 0
    and sp_high_$$year_d_down != 0
    and sp_high_$$year_d_up    > sp_high_$$year_d_down
]] (overall change up, ins > outs)

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$sp_current_total
species. By $$year this number is projected to increase to sp_high_$$year_total species.
While there is an overall increase in biodiversity, the region is
likely to suffer the loss of some species XnativeXtoXtheXregionX.  The climate is projected to become unsuitable for $$sp_high_$$year_d_down species (losses) and suitable for $$sp_high_$$year_d_up species species from outside the region (gains).

[[      sp_high_$$year_d_up   == 0
    and sp_high_$$year_d_down  > 0
]] (overall change down, outs, no ins)

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$sp_current_total
species. By $$year this number is projected to decrease by $$sp_high_$$year_d_down to sp_high_$$year_total.

[[      sp_high_$$year_d_up   != 0
    and sp_high_$$year_d_down != 0
    and sp_high_$$year_d_down  > sp_high_$$year_d_up
]] (overall change down, outs > ins)

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$sp_current_total
species. By $$year this number is projected to decrease to sp_high_$$year_total species. While there is an overall decrease in biodiversity, the region is likely to become suitable for some species not XnativeXtoXtheXregionX.  The climate is projected to become unsuitable for $$sp_high_$$year_d_down species (losses) and suitable for $$sp_high_$$year_d_up species species from outside the region (gains).

[[ sp_high_$$year_d_up > 0 ]]
Note that independent movement of species
into new climate space is limited by the capacity of a species to
disperse.  In light of possible species gains, it is important to
consider that even Australian natives may behave like invasive pests
when invading new space.  Species movement capacity and interaction
with other species is not modelled here.
