Introduction
------------

This report covers blah and blah by doing blah and blah.  It uses data projected out to 2085[[year == 2085]].[[year < 2085]], but focusses on the projected climate and biodiversity situation in $$year.[[always]]

Projection of Future Climate
----------------------------

These results were generated by blah blah.  Projections of the future climate depend on factors to do with scenario/situation etc and accuracy of models.  We selected two scenarios, high and low emissions, etc.  Multiple models were used and the projections of each model blah blah distribution 10% / 50% / 90%.

Uncertainties remain in human activities, accuracy in modelling climate-related geo/bio systems, approximations used when setting modelling resolution, etc etc

Projection of Future Species Distribution
-----------------------------------------

Climate suitability for each species was generated by blah blah. Projections of climate suitability depends on factors such as accuracy and completeness of observation records, sensitivity to various climatological factors, the change in those factors, picking a survival threshold, etc etc.

Uncertainties remain in climate projection, selection of bioclim variables, anthropogenic changes in habitat suitability, survivability of rare events e.g. drought, cyclone, rate of spread into new areas etc etc

Regional Climate Projections
----------------------------

Figure 1 shows the projected change in annual average temperature across $$rg_short_name, in low and high emission scenarios.  Projections are shown for 10th percentile etc etc.

[[year < 2085]]Note that this figure shows projections for 2085.[[always]]

![Figure 1: Projected Temperature Change]($$rg_url/figure1.png)

Highest change across the region is blah blah.

Figure 2 shows the annual average temperature for $$rg_short_name, in low and high emission scenarios.

Regional Biodiversity Implications
----------------------------------

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$sp_current_total species.

Projections for $$year indicate that the region's climate will
[[species_added_reportyear > 0]]become suitable for $$sp_added_reportyear new species,
[[species_lost_reportyear > 0]]become unsuitable for $$sp_lost_reportyear existing species,
[[species_positive_delta_reportyear > 0]] for a net gain of $$sp_positive_delta_reportyear.
[[species_negative_delta_reportyear > 0]] for a net loss of $$sp_negative_delta_reportyear.
