## Introduction

Patterns of biodiversity are already shifting as a result of the
changing climate.  This report uses future Global Cireculation Models
(GCMs) to project the impact of both low and high emissions scenarios
on biodiversity in the future.  It shows how annual mean temperature
and rainfall change decadally to 2085 and the resulting regional
spatial pattern of change in 2085[[year == 2085]].[[year < 2085]],
but focuses on the projected climate and biodiversity situation in
$$year.

### Projection of Future Climate

Brief introduction to future climate stuff

### Projection of Future Species Distribution

Brief intro to biodiversity stuff


## Projection of Future Climate

These results were generated by blah blah.  Projections of the future climate depend on factors to do with scenario/situation etc and accuracy of models.  We selected two scenarios, high and low emissions, etc.  Multiple models were used and the projections of each model blah blah distribution 10% / 50% / 90%.

Uncertainties remain in human activities, accuracy in modelling climate-related geo/bio systems, approximations used when setting modelling resolution, etc etc


###Temperature

All of Australia is projected to experience warming in the future.  Currently, the mean annual temperature for $$rg_short_name is $$temperature_current_mean &deg;, experiencing a range of averages between $$temperature_current_min and $$temperature_current_max.  [[always]]

By $$year, temperature is projected to [[temperature_high_$$year_fiftieth_mean > temperature_current_mean]] increase by $$temperature_high_$$year_fiftieth_d_up. [[temperature_high_$$year_fiftieth_mean < temperature_current_mean]] decrease by $$temperature_high_$$year_fiftieth_d_down, however $$temperature_high_2085_fiftieth_d_down of warming is projected by 2085. 
[[always]]

Figure 1 tracks increase of temperature in $$rg_short_name between 2015 and 2085. 

Figure 2 shows the projected [[$$temperature_high_$$year_fiftieth_mean > $$temperature_current_mean]] increase [[$$temperature_high_$$year_fiftieth_mean < $$temperature_current_mean]] change [[always]] in annual average temperature across $$rg_short_name, in low and high emission scenarios.

[[year < 2085]]Note that this figure shows projections for 2085.[[always]]

###Rainfall

Currently, the mean annual rainfall for $$rg_short_name is $$rainfall_current_mean, experiencing a range of averages between $$rainfall_current_min and $$rainfall_current_max.  [[always]]

Future rainfall projections are much more variable.  By $$year, rainfall is projected to [[$$rainfall_high_$$year_fiftieth_mean > $$rainfall_current_mean]] increase by $$rainfall_high_$$year_fiftieth_d_up. [[$$rainfall_high_$$year_fiftieth_mean < $$rainfall_current_mean]] decrease by $$rainfall_high_$$year_fiftieth_d_down, however $$rainfall_high_2085_fiftieth_d_down of rainfall is projected by 2085. 
[[always]]

Figure 3 tracks increase of rainfall in $$rg_short_name between 2015 and 2085. 

[[$$rainfall_high_2085_fiftieth_mean < $$rainfall_current_mean
    and $$rainfall_high_2085_tenth_mean < $$rainfall_current_mean]]
    
All models predict a decrease in rainfall, by between $$rainfall_high_$$year_tenth_d_down however some predict an increase of as much as $$rainfall_high_$$year_ninetieth_d_down.

[[$$rainfall_high_2085_fiftieth_mean < $$rainfall_current_mean
    and $$rainfall_high_2085_tenth_mean > $$rainfall_current_mean]]
    
Most models predict a decrease in rainfall, by as much as $$rainfall_high_$$year_tenth_d_down, however some predict an increase of as much as $$rainfall_high_$$year_tenth_d_up.

[[$$rainfall_high_2085_fiftieth_mean > $$rainfall_current_mean
    and $$rainfall_high_2085_tenth_mean > $$rainfall_current_mean]]
    
All models predict an increase in rainfall, by between $$rainfall_high_$$year_tenth_d_up and $$rainfall_high_$$year_ninetieth_d_up.

[[$$rainfall_high_2085_fiftieth_mean > $$rainfall_current_mean
    and $$rainfall_high_2085_tenth_mean < $$rainfall_current_mean]]
    
Most models predict an increase in rainfall, by as much as $$rainfall_high_$$year_ninetieth_d_up, however some predict an decrease of as much as $$rainfall_high_$$year_tenth_d_down.

[[always]]

Figure 4 shows the projected [[$$rainfall_high_$$year_fiftieth_mean > $$rainfall_current_mean]] increase [[$$rainfall_high_$$year_fiftieth_mean < $$rainfall_current_mean]] change [[always]] in annual average rainfall across $$rg_short_name, in low and high emission scenarios.

## Projection of Future Species Distribution

Climate suitability for each species was generated by blah blah. Projections of climate suitability depends on factors such as accuracy and completeness of observation records, sensitivity to various climatological factors, the change in those factors, picking a survival threshold, etc etc.

Uncertainties remain in climate projection, selection of bioclim variables, anthropogenic changes in habitat suitability, survivability of rare events e.g. drought, cyclone, rate of spread into new areas etc etc

### Regional Biodiversity Implications

[[      high_delta_up_$$year   == 0
    and high_delta_down_$$year == 0
]] (no change at all)

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$high_total_current species. The climate in $$year is projected to remain suitable for all species.

[[      high_delta_up_$$year != 0
    and high_delta_up_$$year == high_delta_down_$$year
]] (no overall change, ins = outs)

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$high_total_current
species. By $$year, the total number of species is projected to stay the same, however a change in climate suitability suggests a change in species composition.  The climate is projected to become
unsuitable for $$high_delta_down_$$year species XnativeXtoXtheXregionX (losses) and suitable for $$high_delta_up_$$year species (gains).

[[      high_delta_up_$$year    > 0
    and high_delta_down_$$year == 0
]] (overall change up, ins, no outs)

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$high_total_current
species. By $$year this number is projected to increase by $$high_delta_up_$$year species to high_total_$$year.
The climate is likely to remain suitable for species currently
found in the region.

[[      high_delta_up_$$year   != 0
    and high_delta_down_$$year != 0
    and high_delta_up_$$year    > high_delta_down_$$year
]] (overall change up, ins > outs)

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$high_total_current
species. By $$year this number is projected to increase to high_total_$$year species.
While there is an overall increase in biodiversity, the region is
likely to suffer the loss of some species XnativeXtoXtheXregionX.  The climate is projected to become unsuitable for $$high_delta_down_$$year species (losses) and suitable for $$high_delta_up_$$year species species from outside the region (gains).

[[      high_delta_up_$$year   == 0
    and high_delta_down_$$year  > 0
]] (overall change down, outs, no ins)

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$high_total_current
species. By $$year this number is projected to decrease by $$high_delta_down_$$year to high_total_$$year.

[[      high_delta_up_$$year   != 0
    and high_delta_down_$$year != 0
    and high_delta_down_$$year  > high_delta_up_$$year
]] (overall change down, outs > ins)

$$rg_long_name currently has climate suitable for $$high_total_current
species. By $$year this number is projected to decrease to high_total_$$year species. While there is an overall decrease in biodiversity, the region is likely to become suitable for some species not XnativeXtoXtheXregionX.  The climate is projected to become unsuitable for $$high_delta_down_$$year species (losses) and suitable for $$high_delta_up_$$year species species from outside the region (gains).

[[ high_delta_up_$$year > 0 ]]
Note that independent movement of species
into new climate space is limited by the capacity of a species to
disperse.  In light of possible species gains, it is important to
consider that even Australian natives may behave like invasive pests
when invading new space.  Species movement capacity and interaction
with other species is not modelled here.
